<h1> <em> Tulsa, Oklahoma.... A walk through time!</em>
</h1>

<h2 <span style="color:red"> The Early Years </span> </h2>
    <p> Tulsa was first settled between 1828 and 1836. At that time the Lochapoka Band of the Creek Native American Indian tribe first set foot on their new home. Tulsa wa\
s part of what was known as "Indian Territory", which was created for the 5 civilized tribes, the Choctaw, Cherokee, Muscogee Creek, Chickisaw, and Seminoles people. The L\
ochapoka clan were the first to claim the area that is now known as Tulsa. Their name stands for "Turtle Clan" and they are descendents from the Muscogee Creek people. For\
ced from their native homes in Alabama, the Lochapoka tribe settled on what is now present-day Cheyenne Avenue and 18th Street under a large Burr Oak tree now called <a hr\
ef="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creek_Council_Oak_Tree ">Council Oak Tree </a>, there they rekindled their ceremonial fire and named their new settlement "Tulasi" meanin\
g "Old town" in their native language. Years would pass and more people would show, in the year 1880 a methodist minsiter by the name of Rev. Sylvester Morris built a hous\
e in what is now Tulsa's oldest neighborhood Owen Park and it still stands today. To learn more about former Native American Reservations in Oklahoma click the picture bel\

<h2>
 <span style="color:red"> Oil Boom!
</h2>
<p> In the year 1901 Tulsa changed from being a small frontier town to a growing prospering Â¨Boom Town. With the discovery of oil at Red Fork, a small community southwest \
of Tulsa across the Arkansas river, Tulsa was set on a path towards success and prosperity. In 1905 the Glenpool was discovered, with it came the need for storage and tran\
sportation for the newly found massive pool of crude oil. This would place Tulsa at the top, a leader in Oil and Gas and the center of the growing petroleum industry. Some\
 prominent names like J. Paul Getty and Harry Ford Sinclair recieved their initial start from the discovery of the Glen Pool. In 1907 the Oklahoma Natural Gas Company buil\
t a pipeline from the Glenpool to provide gas to Oklahoma City. The giant oilfield had produced 326 million barrels of oil by 1986, millions of dollars in royalties were p\
aid per year to Creek Native Americans who held 160-acre allotments in the field. It is said that "<i>more money was made on the Glenpoool oil field than the California Go\
ld Rush and the Colorado Silver Rush combined </i>". The historic Oklahoma oil field still produces today with new water-flood and other enhanced technology.

<h3> Tulsa Today! </h3>

<p> Today Tulsa is home to more than 383,500 Oklahomans. A lot of time has passed since the first Native American tribes set foot on this land or since the first drops of \
oil came spewing out of the ground but Tulsa still has a lot more to offer the world. As a leader in the aerospace and petrol industries Tulsa understands that people are \
who get things done and that people are worth investing in. Tulsa is set to become a "tech hub" in the next couple of years. Some prominent school names in the area are Ok\
lahoma State University Tulsa, Oral Roberts University, <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com">Holberton School of Coding and Software Engineering</a>, Tulsa University\
, North Eastern State Univeristy and more... As a proud Tulsan I encourage anyone that has not visited this beautiful city to do so and discover the possibilities that are\
 held within its city limits and its people.</p>
